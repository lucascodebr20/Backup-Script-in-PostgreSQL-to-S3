# 📦 Script Backup Collection  

This repository contains a collection of **single-file backup scripts** written in different programming languages.  
Each script is designed to be **easily integrated into your project** without relying on external tools or complex setups.

## 💡 Motivation  

The idea for this project came when I needed to implement backups in a project but didn’t want to rely on installing extra tools or writing system-specific scripts.  

Instead, I created a **Java version** that could be dropped directly into the project, ensuring:  

✅ **Easy integration** – a single file you can plug into your codebase.  
✅ **Transparency** – no hidden layers of abstraction; you can inspect the entire code yourself.  
✅ **Reliability** – simple, direct, and self-contained.

## 📂 Structure  

Each folder contains a script written in a different language.  
Inside each folder, you will find a dedicated **README.md** with detailed usage instructions for that specific implementation.

## 🎯 Goal  

The goal of this repository is to provide a set of **plug-and-play backup scripts** that can be adapted across different technologies while keeping everything:  

- ✨ Minimal  
- 📖 Clear  
- 🔧 Maintainable
